# PR Message Format Rules

This rule defines guidelines for Pull Request (PR) titles and bodies.

## Role of this rule

- This rule defines the PR message format in a way that is consistent with the commit message convention (`commit-message-format.mdc`) based on Conventional Commits.
- The `Prefix` and summary style are aligned with commit messages, while the PR body is required to be structured into sections such as "Overview", "Changes", and "Tests".
- When reusing this rule in other projects, adjust `language` and required sections (e.g. “Technical details”) according to your project’s policy.

## Language

- In this file, `language` is a logical name representing the language used in PR messages.
- `language = "en"`
- The title and body should, in principle, be written in the language specified by `language`.

## Title (first line)

### Format (required)

```
<Prefix>: <summary (imperative / concise)>
```

- `Prefix` is recommended to use the same `type` as in Conventional Commits (e.g. `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`).
- Write concisely in the language specified by `language` and avoid a trailing period.
- Briefly express what was changed and, if needed, why, aiming for about 50 characters.

## Body (structured format)

### Recommended template

PR bodies should use a structured format like the following:

```markdown
## Overview

Short summary of what this PR implements or fixes.

## Changes

- Describe change 1
- Describe change 2
- Describe change 3

## Technical details (optional)

- Describe implementation details or design intent, if needed

## Tests

- Types of tests run (unit tests, E2E tests, manual verification, etc.)
- Key verification results

## Related issues

- Closes #123
- Refs #456
```

- "Overview" and "Changes" are considered required sections.
- "Technical details", "Tests", and "Related issues" may be required depending on your project’s rules.
- Each bullet point should clearly describe what was changed, where, and why.

## Message generation principles

- PR titles and bodies must always be based on the **actual diff and commit history** (e.g. by using `git diff`, `git log`).
- Do not rely solely on issue titles or branch names; explicitly describe the changes, impact, and tests in the body.
- When AI or scripts generate PR messages, they should use diffs, commit history, and related issue information as input.
- Choose Prefix and summaries in a way that is consistent with the commit message rules (`commit-message-format.mdc`) to avoid semantic mismatch between commits and PRs.

## Prohibited patterns

- Writing titles or bodies only in a different language than specified by `language`.
- Vague titles that do not convey meaning (e.g. "update", "fix issue", "changes").
- Unstructured walls of text without headings or bullet lists, making it hard to understand the content.
- Descriptions that contradict the actual diff, or that intentionally omit important changes, impact, or test results.
